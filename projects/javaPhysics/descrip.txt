&nbsp&nbsp This project is a jumping off point for any Java based 2D graphics rendering. Includes a variable timestep clock with interpolation based graphic drawing. An entity class allows for easy subclassing of new objects to render as well as easy world settings to adjust for a viewport with a panning camera effect. The clock that runs the drawing and updating of the 2D environment is fairly standard but is my first implementation of a non-constant timestep clock. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp Future development into this project would have the project be packaged and easily imported. As it stands, a cloned version of this template can be built on top of. This template was used in the creation of the <a href="javascript:jumpToProject('earthMap')()">Earth Map</a> project and has been extended to include some physics in the <a href="javascript:jumpToProject('collision')()">2D Colliders</a> project.
