&nbsp&nbsp This project contains both development branches for a Mac OS X client written in Swift and an app server, hosted through AWS, with a MEAN stack. On the server side, Ubuntu 16 responds listens for traffic using Nginx. Nginx simply serves as a reverse proxy  for delegating traffic to the NodeJS processes. Documentation and protocol specifications are documented in the GitHub repository's readme.txt linked above. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp This project uses many modern security features: JavaScript Web Token, Apple's Security suite, asymmetric (256-byte RSA) encryption, PKCS7 padding, message authentication codes, SSL (TLS v1.2), hashing (SHA256), salting (Password storage, 128 bits of CSPRNG integers), double login API routes (or "remote login"), and generated challenge login.
