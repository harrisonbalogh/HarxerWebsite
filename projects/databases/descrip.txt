&nbsp&nbsp While this isn’t a specific project, this section organizes anything I’ve worked on in the realm of databases. This is one of the few platforms that I’ve primarily learned from the classroom as I’ve not been forced into using databases in my personal projects.<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp Any databases that I have used are listed in the Architecture section. I’ve locally hosted MySQL servers and connected to them using software like Netbeans for practice and direct table entry, creation, and manipulation. I have had practice with JDBC  as a platform for editing MySQL outside of the console. These were only school related projects, however and no personal usage to note here.
