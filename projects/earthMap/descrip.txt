&nbsp&nbsp Earth Map is another fork of the <a href="javascript:jumpToProject('javaPhysics')()">2D Template Environment</a> project. Earlier versions of the template did not include zoom functionality, so after implementing zoom into the map project, I went back and made it standard in the template. So the only unique implementation this project contains is the grid line functionality and marking entities as 'unzoomable' (so entities on the map, like the pin, don't get smaller as you zoom in but maintain their exact position). <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp The grid lines are also unique to this project. As seen in the video sample, they are added or removed based on the zoom level. Grid lines can alternatively be turned off to stop rendering them. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp The sample video shows the template environment's zooming and panning functionality. <br><br>
