&nbsp&nbsp This project written in Java implements a 'Collider' interface to the <a href="javascript:jumpToProject('javaPhysics')()">2D Template Environment</a>. Collider entities can be any convex polygon and will displace each other based on the translation vector acquired from Separating Axis Theorem calculations. The system does not do collision prediction based on an entities velocity so it takes a frame for an entity to be displaced. This can be seen in the sample video above. That is, while being pushed, you can momentarily see objects being inside one another. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp I may add rotational velocity to this project to be able to roll objects around each other as well as push but that may require writing a smarter system for calculating the force vectors on each entity. The template environment already allows for gravity so if I do add rotational velocity I could make the 2D Template Environment a 2D Physics Template Environment. <br><br>
