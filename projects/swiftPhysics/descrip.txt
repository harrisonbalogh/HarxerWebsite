&nbsp&nbsp This project on iOS focuses on SpriteKit, Apple’s 2D physics environment libraries. While the project does not bring forth a coherent “game” experience, it does take advantage of many of SpriteKit’s functionality. Most importantly applying impulses to move gravity-inhibited sprites, as the camera follows along. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp I wrote my own geometry heavy functions to do dynamic arm and leg reaching movements for humanoid characters in this project primarily to server more intricate and realistic animations. The original drawn frame animations for the character’s run animation can be found in the <a href="javascript:jumpToProject('art')()">Art Assets</a> project but I adapted this using creating a sort of style sheet of animations that simply moved individual body parts. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp I have very little aspiration in animation so this project has just about reached its final point of development. I may however continue to optimize my custom geometric reaching functions or iron out a even faster way to roll out dynamic animations.
