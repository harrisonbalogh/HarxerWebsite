&nbsp&nbsp 'Pathing' may be a misnomer - seeing as the entity that swims around the screen does not formulate a path but rather a single waypoint at a time. It may be more aptly titled 'Sight'. The swimming wisp raycasts a line to its target and checks that against the array of blockers. It accounts for its own slithering motion it (visually) uses to move. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp The wisp mostly uses vector projections to determine the shortest waypoint to the vertex of the blocker that sticks out the most - and moves in that direction. Note: It accelerates and decelerates to arrive as quickly but accurately as possible to its target.  And it will often run into blockers when making sharp turns, so further iterations will account for changing direction of velocity when making waypoint decisions. <br><br>
