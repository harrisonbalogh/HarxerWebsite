&nbsp&nbsp Munch is a Java based 2D game. This older implementation of Java AWT graphics does not use an optimized update/redraw clock nor interpolation for entity positions - unlike the <a href="javascript:jumpToProject('helikopter')()">Helicopter</a> project. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp This project does goes deeper into the user interface side of development. It uses my own functions for sliding AWT graphical components backed by a custom update clock solely for the GUI animations. <br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp Other significant work has gone into Munchâ€™s spawning system. The game is played by avoiding larger blocks and eating blocks equal size to your character. Randomly sized blocks are spawned in random locations so there are many instances, while playing, that there is no way to survive an oncoming wave of blocks. That is to say, a path must always be available for the player to dodge or be capable of using skill to maneuver the large blocks. So the algorithm in place traces all available paths in real time and when only one path is available for the player to take, it will prevent spawning of larger blocks in that path until another trail presents itself. This can be refined as cases due arise in which the player gets stuck and is forced to lose.
