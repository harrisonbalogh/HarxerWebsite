&nbsp&nbsp Harxer.com serves as a portfolio for coding projects I've developed over the years. This site is not deployed with a CMS nor was it created using a front-end framework. I've written all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this site exclusively - excluding libraries from GSAP's TweenLite which provides HTML element animated transitioning.<br><br>

This site has gone through several iterations and will most likely continue to be under active development. <br><br>
