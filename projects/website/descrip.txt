&nbsp&nbsp Harxer.com serves as a portfolio for coding projects I've developed over the years. This site is not deployed with a CMS nor was it created using a front-end framework. I've written all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for this site exclusively - excluding libraries from GSAP's TweenLite which provides HTML element animated transitioning. This site is served by Nginx solely on HTTPS using a LetsEncrypt certificate with required HTTP2 protocol.<br><br>
